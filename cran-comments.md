## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed duplicate "Description:" text in DESCRIPTION file
* Wrapped all package names in single quotes in DESCRIPTION (Title and Description fields)
* Added proper citations for methods used:
  - colorspace package for CVD simulation: Zeileis et al. (2020) <doi:10.18637/jss.v096.i01>
  - WCAG 2.1 guidelines for contrast calculations: W3C (2018) <https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum>
* Replaced cat() with message() for suppressible console output in R/gg_suggest_fixes.R
* Created proper S3 print methods (print.gg_fix_suggestions) for structured output display

All console output is now suppressible using suppressMessages() or by capturing 
return values, following R best practices. Print methods appropriately use cat() 
for formatted display, as per CRAN guidelines.
